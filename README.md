This package implents a network inference algorithm taking care of possible redundancies
in the information transfer process for both inter and intra-lag connections. The algorithm
uses a set of rules alongside conditional causality estimators to remove such redundancies.
The proposed conditional causality estimators are the Granger Causality, the Transfer Entropy
and the cross-time Mutual Information.
